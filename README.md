# PSID Data Project
In this project I took PSID data from 1996 and transformed it to create usable data. Some data was dropped which was not relevant and many dummy variables were created from source variables which clustered different qualitative data.

The project has two groups, the "Assignment Files" which contain the instructions for the final turn-in and the finalized turn-in itself.

The second group are the "Data Files" which contain the raw data, the codebook for the data, the Stata script used to alter the data, and the finalized summary statistics of all variables.
